Instrumental Approach to Voltammetry
====================================

In this three week module, you will learn about the electrochemical method called *cyclic voltammetry* by building an instrument that performs the technique: a *potentiostat*.  We are going to use an *instrumental approach* whereby the focus will be on how to create an instrument that does the experiment we want to perform.
