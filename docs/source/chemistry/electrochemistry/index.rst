1. What is voltammetry and why is it useful?  Perhaps read an introductory article on using voltammetry to determine the concentration of ascorbic acid in a fruit juice
2. What are the important theoretical concepts in voltammetry: reactions occur at the electrode/liquid interface rather than the bulk, current is a measure of the rate of the reaction, equilibrium is rarely achieved, electrode potential provides a driving force for the reaction, concentration gradients strongly influence the rate of the reaction.
3. What is a potentiostat?
