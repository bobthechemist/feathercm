What is a Feather?
==================

From the `Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/category/943>`_ website:

  Feather is a flexible and powerful family of microcontroller main-boards (Feathers) and daughter-boards (Wings) with a wide range of capabilities. They can be plugged into a breadboard for quick prototyping, have built-in battery connectors for your on-the-go projects, and most have built-in lipoly chargers!

We use the Feather platform because it's cheap, powerful and flexible.
