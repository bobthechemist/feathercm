**Welcome**. If you are here, you were either invited or spend an awful lot of time randomly clicking links on the internet...

``FeAtHEr-Cm`` is a platform for building a better understanding of scientific instrumentation.  It is my attempt at developing what I call an *Instrumental Approach to Chemical Analysis.*  Traditionally, the second semester of analytical chemistry covers instrumentation used in the discipline.  Recent advances in technology, electronics and programming allow us to explore how scientific measurements are made by *designing our own instruments* and using them to explore chemical systems.  FeAtHEr-Cm helps us do that.

A work in progress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project is in the very early stages of development.  If you are visiting, you will likely find links that do not work, documentation that seems to require a significant amount of prerequisite knowledge, and many, many outlines and placeholders.  My intention for a *version 1.0* of this project is an instrument with activities for each of the three main areas of chemical instrumentation (spectroscopy, electrochemistry and chromatography).  I am currently working on the electrochemistry modules.

An open, collaborative effort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am building this project using `github <github.com>`_ and `read the docs <readthedocs.com>`_ for a few important reasons.

* Both platforms provide open access to the content, so that others may view, use and modify what is presented here
* Both platforms work nicely together, allowing me to generate both software and instructional content in one location and have it display in a pretty format without much input on my part.
* This approach allows community members to contribute to the project either as content generators or content reviewers.

I imagine that users of the content will find typographical and content errors and wish to propose corrections; others may have suggestions on how to better present content.  With Github, those users should be able to make those requests in a documented, public fashion.  If the changes are accepted, they get pushed immediately to the project.

What to explore right now
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current area of activity is building the potentiostat, creating software for controlling it and developing activities for exploring how a potentiostat is built and operated.  You will likely see the most changes in these pages over the next few weeks.
