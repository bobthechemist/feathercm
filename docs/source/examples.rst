Some other example
******************

.. math::

    n_{\mathrm{offset}} = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} s_k n_k

    \ce{H2O -> H2 + O2}


.. seealso:: this is a simple **seealso** note.

.. note:: This is a **note** box.

.. warning:: this is a warning to you.

    :subtitle: Optional Sidebar Subtitle

    Subsequent indented lines comprise
    the body of the sidebar, and are
    interpreted as body elements.

Really cool embed

Wouldn't it be nice if you could embed code for dynamic web-based textbooks?

.. raw:: html

  <iframe width='100%' height='300' src='https://rdrr.io/snippets/embed/' frameborder='0'></iframe>
