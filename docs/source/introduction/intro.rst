Introduction: Instrumental Approach to Chemical Analysis
========================================================

In this introductory module, you will jump in to instrumental design by building an instrument - a papercraft spectrograph - that you connect to the camera of your phone.  You'll then learn about classifying data types using the concept of *data domains* and as a result, develop a good understanding of *what is a scientific instrument* and *what is a measurement*.  You then shift gears to an introductory exploration of the microcontroller used to make most of your scientific instruments along with the programming language, CircuitPython.  Lastly, this module introduces some practical electronics topics such as soldering, which will allow you to put together your instrument kits.
