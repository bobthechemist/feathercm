Spectroscopy
==============

Many instrument design labs explore colorimetry or spectrophotometry, and the intention here is not to reinvent the wheel but to add to it.  We will explore some aspects of instrument design such as signal amplification, non-chemical deviations from Beer's Law, signal transduction and task-specific design.

* Review of spectroscopy fundamentals
* Design and implementation of a colorimeter
* Possibly building an endpoint detector for `this <https://pubs-acs-org.brockport.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c01165>`_
