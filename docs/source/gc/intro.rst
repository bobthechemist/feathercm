Gas Chromatograph
=================

A gas chromatograph is one of the more common instruments in chemistry laboratories.  Commercial instruments use high pressure gases, autosamplers, and expensive columns.  The instrument designed here will be fairly limited in scope, but will allow for an exploration of the concepts of chromatograph design and serve as a platform for some types of interesting chemical analyses.
