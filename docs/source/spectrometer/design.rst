Turbidimetry instrument design
==============================

In designing our instrument, we will build upon several aspects of electronics introduced in the electrochemistry section.  You should be familiar with operational amplifiers and passive components.  Recalling the types of operational amplifier circuits may be helpful, but is not necessary.

Discuss a block diagram of the spectrometer and specify that we need to discuss LEDs, transistors and filters.  We'll then conclude with the schematic.
