Thermal Conductivity Detector
=============================

A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) finds use in analysis of gases.  Additionally, it uses an important, fundamental circuit design called a Whetstone bridge.  Therefore, it is an interesting component to add to our toolbox of instrumental approaches to chemical analysis.
