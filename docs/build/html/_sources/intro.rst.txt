``FeAtHEr-Cm`` is a platform for building a better understanding of scientific instrumentation.

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Many STEM students struggle with understanding how computers and electronics play a role in the acquisition of scientific data.  Plus, I like to build things.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The instrumentation described in this project is designed with education in mind.  Research-quality data acquisition will require further development of the base system described here.

Much of this content is an outline - in other words, there isn't much content right now.  I'm learning stuff.
