Noise out of 6004A is fairly significant relative to what's coming from A0.  Adding a 105 cap across the feedback resistor reduces noise with a bit of change in the slope at 2 V.  Upon closer look, adding a cap doesn't improve the noise enough for me to bother, I think.  Might include an open space.

A number of updates to data and echem.  Confirmed that manual iR correction is working.  Can clean up CVs a bit with lowpassfiltering of the data (so post processing).  Added indicator light so user knows when CV scan is complete.  Added command to adjust C2V resistor value.
