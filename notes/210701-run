Mathematica 12.3 may be required for python integration to run.  Not a priority as we can run python from command line

Useful to have atom (with git connection) and python installed on client computer

python interface will be nice

* write function has s.write(f'{cmd}\n\r'.encode('utf-8'))
* read command has code from M example
* Created a client.py for easy communication via python
* need to handle garbage collection  default frequency incompatible with scan rates around 0.2 V/s
* Can probably simplify byte to string with b'bytearray'.decode()
